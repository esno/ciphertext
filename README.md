# ciphertext

share your secret token with other people and crypt the stuff you want to say.

## why

Mail encryption is a mess. Most people don't have a key or at least the key is not reliable.
One simple example: Try to write an encrypted mail to someones business address.

You see? Many companies do not have any public key-server to share their keys.
Others missing mailcrypto completely.

## how

* choose a token and share it to the person you want to write something.
    * share the token only in reallife.
* insert your token into the top box.
* insert your plaintext/ciphertext in the left box.
* press crypt / decrypt.
* send ciphertext via mail.
